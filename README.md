# RefreshableScrollViewDemo

**This project is no longer in use.** Wrapping SwiftUI views in UIKit views, and embedding them again in SwiftUI is a significant source of bugs. Be warned!

Sample project that contains several custom refreshable SwiftUI views. 
This is based on the [RefreshableScrollView](https://github.com/Q42/RefreshableScrollView) Swift Package.
